1) background.js -> chrome tabs update yeh sab info rakhta
background scripts are non-persistent service workers that are loaded 
in response to browser events and unloaded upon code completion. 
They cannot run code indefinitely like popup/options/sidebar pages and must be attached to an event


2) contentScript.js -> woh webpage jo khula hai uska info rakhta and listens to background.js
They run in the context of the web page and can alter the DOM and behavior of any page to add features into it.
 Content scripts are scoped to the page where they are injected and are limited to the context of that page, 
 so they cannot persist data across tabs and origins or surface data outside the page. 
 They are essential for altering the DOM and behavior of certain webpages


3) popup -> extension html aur usse interact karna using dom tree aur function lagana + chrome api use like chrome.storage
The popup script is associated with the popup page of your extension, which is a UI page that
 appears when the user clicks on the extension's icon. 
 This script is responsible for handling UI-related code and interactions. 
Popup pages are granted every feature requested in the manifest file and can display a custom UI hosted locally.


  // sendMessage from background, popup //OnMessage on contentScript
   aise communication hota hai
